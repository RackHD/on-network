 - [ModelError](docs/ModelError.md)


## Documentation For Authorization
After generating the code we edited the file configure_on_network.go to disable authentication.
In configure_on_network.go - Generated Code:
	api.APIKeyHeaderAuth = func(token string) (interface{}, error) {
		return nil, errors.NotImplemented("api key auth (APIKeyHeader) authorization from header param [authorization] has not yet been implemented")
	}

In configure_on_network.go - Modified Code:
```
   api.APIKeyHeaderAuth = func(token string) (interface{}, error) {
		return token, nil
   }
```


## Documentation for Handlers

The handler is added in the controller folder. For example, the code  for the about api is in on-network/controllers/about/about.go

After generating the code, configure_on_nertwork.go had to be changed as well to call the handler code.
Here is an example to what had to be done for `about` api

In  on_network_api.go - Generated Code:
```
    api.AboutAboutGetHandler = about.AboutGetHandlerFunc(func(params about.AboutGetParams, principal interface{}) middleware.Responder {
    		return middleware.NotImplemented("operation about.AboutGet has not yet been implemented")
    	})
```

In  on_network_api.go - Modified Code:
```
    api.AboutAboutGetHandler = about.AboutGetHandlerFunc(func(params about.AboutGetParams, principal interface{}) middleware.Responder {
		return aboutctrl.MiddleWare(params.HTTPRequest)
	})
```


## APIKeyHeader

- **Type**: API key
- **API key parameter name**: authorization
